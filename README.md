## Regional Recipes

The app fetches recipes from around the world, including African dishes, using public APIs:

- **TheMealDB**: Searches for dishes by name and area (jollof, banku, fufu, waakye, kenkey, egusi, suya, etc.)
- **Area filtering**: Finds recipes by geographical area (Ghana, Nigeria, Moroccan, Egyptian, Ethiopian, etc.)
- **Smart search**: Automatically detects available areas and searches common dish names

All recipes are fetched dynamically from APIs - no hardcoded data!

## API Configuration

All APIs are **100% free** - no API keys required! Control which APIs to use via environment variables:

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_USE_THEMEALDB=true` - Enable TheMealDB (default: true)
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_USE_THE_COCKTAIL_DB=true` - Enable TheCocktailDB (default: true)
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_USE_RECIPEPUPPY=false` - Enable RecipePuppy as fallback (default: false)

No setup required - all APIs work out of the box!

## Admin Panel

Access the admin panel at `/admin` to submit new recipes. 

1. Enter the admin token (set in `.env.local` as `NEXT_PUBLIC_ADMIN_TOKEN`)
2. Fill out the recipe form
3. Submit to save locally (recipes are stored in localStorage)

**Note**: In production, you should implement a proper backend or serverless function to store recipes.

## Building for Production

npm run build
npm start
```
